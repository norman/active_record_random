= ActiveRecordRandom

This plugin adds 

  :order => :random 
  
to all the default ActiveRecord adapters. This means you can do this:

  Post.find(:all, :order => :random, :limit => 10)

and it will work for MySQL, SQLite or Postgres without having to change the
query. It also works for named scopes:

  named_scope :randomized, :order => :random

== Why?

Because MySQL has a different syntax than Postgres and SQLite for ordering by
random. If you develop or test on SQLite and then deploy on MySQL, this is
annoying. This plugin solves the problem.

== Shouldn't this be a patch to Rails?

I {submitted it as a
patch}[http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1274-patch-add-support-for-order-random-in-queries],
but I'm such a loser that nobody gave me a +1. So for now it's just a lowly
plugin.
